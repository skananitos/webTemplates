# Simple Dashboard

A single page app which functions as a simple dashboard developed by using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript. 

The dashboard is a grid with a combination of widgets that have text inside. To add a new widget to the grid, there is a text box with a button next to it, so that users can type the text they want to have inside the widget and add it by pressing the button.

It is also possible to delete widgets. In addition, users can drag and drop the widgets in case they want to change their order.
