# Billing Form

This JavaScript code enables auto-complete on the form. Whenever the checkbox is checked, the code automatically copy the values from Shipping Name and Shipping Zip fields into the Billing Name and Billing Zip fields. If the checkbox is unchecked, the Billing Name and Billing Zip fields go blank.
